# WeatherApp via OpenWeatherMap API
This project was completed with Codenation to learn how to use Express JS, Express-Handlebars JS. Here we used handlebars to connect the front-end to the back-end and http methods to post and get data from OpenWeatherMap.org API key. URL replacement allows for location of interests to be viewed with ease. Potentail improvements would include conditional formatting for temperature background colour and a responsive style sheet.
